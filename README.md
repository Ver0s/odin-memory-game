# Odin memory game

**Live: https://ver0s.github.io/odin-memory-game/**

A simple game I put together to learn the concepts of hooks in React and put the knowledge I gained from reading new React Beta docs into practice. It was also the first time I used Typescript.

I'm really enjoying this new technology, it's quite a learning curve, but I will probably not go back to writing in vanilla JS. I can't wait to use it in a bigger project, it will definitely be a challenge, but I'm sure I'll be much better off using Typescript than vanilla JavaScript.
